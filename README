This is the MVP for a web ap for keeping score for a super fun dice game called "Farkle"

To begin all you do is register and start entering the info.

Currently the app only keeps the final scores for players.  I'll add functionality for keeping score during game play at a later date.

I created this app to fulfill the requirements for CodeLouisville's C# course.
